                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>For hundreds of years, people have wondered how the mind operates. The mind is fast, efficient, and versatile. Made of a network of approximately 81 billion neurons each with a unique purpose, the human mind can find patterns, execute complex series of muscle actions, and create novel, abstract ideas. The power of the human mind has inspired numerous individuals throughout the past few millenia to develop an artificial mind.</p>
                    <p>I chose this subject for its importance in current and future technologies. Just recently, the study of artificial intelligence has become a quickly moving field. Nearly two decades ago, Deep Blue, a chess playing robot, beat Kasparov, the reigning world chess player at the time. Just 7 years ago, Stanford won the DARPA Grand Challenge with an autonomous vehicle that traversed over 100 miles of unbeforeseen road. Some estimates predict the first self-driving cars will hit the market by 2020. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon use AI today to find patterns in complex social and link graphs in order to provide personal results to users.</p>
                    <p>Building machines that can think both quickly and creatively can solve complex problems on their own. What if a supercomputer could discover a cure for a disease with nothing more than biological and chemical models, an understanding of chemical interations, and a few months to spare what might take scientists decades to find? What if a computer could create a more efficient means of solar power in a few weeks than researchers could find in 20 years? It is clear that technology like this would revolutionize our planet and would vastly quicken the pace of innovation.</p>

                    <h1>Neurons and Neural Networks</h1>
                    <p>A <b>neuron</b> is a cell that takes in electrical input from one or more cells and outputs some electrical response.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>A <b>synapse</b> is an electrical transfer between two neurons.</p>

                    <p>A <b>neural network</b> is a collection of neurons arranged in a network that takes in electrical input and outputs some electrical response and collectively performs some task, such as recognize a face, add two numbers together, or memorize a phone number.</p>

                    <p>The basis of biological learning is neural plasticity. </p>

                    <h1>Bioinspiration of Artificial Neural Networks</h1>
                    <p>In 1958, Frank Rosenblatt created an algorithm called the perceptron, inspired by biological neural networks to acheive pattern recognition. Rosenblatt's algorithm could learn to add, and subtract. It wasn't until the discovery of the backpropagation algorithm by Paul Werbos in 1975 that the perception algorithm could acheive more complex patterns such as the exclusive-or logical operator.</p>
                    <p>However, artificial neural networks research slowed in the 1980's and 90's as computers were not powerful enough to process large neural networks and emerging simpler models briefly found greater accuracy. In the 2000's, neural networks rose to prominense again with the advent of deep learning.</p>

                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>Imagine a world in the future in which intelligent thought was not limited to humans but existed in computers as well. To some, this may be a scary thought. The idea that computers could challenge us intellectually may appear to some to mean the end of the human race. I would like to dispell this fear and give an idea of how artificial intelligence could help society. What if a supercomputer could discover a cure for a disease with nothing more than biological and chemical models and an understanding of chemical interations in a few months what could take scientists decades to find? What if a computer could create a more efficient means of solar power in a few weeks than researchers could find in 20 years? It is clear that technology like this would revolutionize our planet. However, this is type of technology is perhaps decades or even centuries off.</p>
